    """SQL fragment: TRUE if any CurrentScan row for mac_column asserts presence.
    The one and only definition of 'is this MAC present this cycle' - every
    caller uses this, nobody writes their own CurrentScan presence predicate.

    mac_column MUST be a trusted, hardcoded SQL column/table.column reference
    written by NetAlertX code (e.g. "devMac", "CurrentScan.scanMac") - this
    function does raw string interpolation, not parameterized SQL. Never pass
    plugin data, user input, or any runtime string value here.

    The inner CurrentScan is aliased as presence_scan so a qualified
    mac_column like "CurrentScan.scanMac" resolves to the outer reference,
    not this subquery's own row - without the alias the bare table name
    shadows it, turning the comparison into a same-row tautology that's
    true for any row with a non-NULL scanMac. mac_column may not reference
    presence_scan itself for the same reason.

    Not usable everywhere a presence check appears: the "New Connections"
    query in session_events.py and the raw Sessions insert in
    create_new_devices() (device_handling.py) both need the actual
    scanLastIP/scanVendor *values* off the presence-asserting row via a
    MIN()/GROUP BY aggregate, not just a boolean - see
    scan-pipeline-hardening.md Design §1's correction for why those two
    (plus "IP Changed", an eighth non-canonical site) keep their own
    hand-written aggregation instead of calling this helper.

    consider mac_column present, based on this cycle's CurrentScan rows for
    its NIC children (devParentRelType = 'nic') and its own devReqNicsOnline
    (ANY vs ALL)?' It intentionally does not read or write
    Devices.devPresentLastScan - see nic-parent-orphan-disconnect-events.md's
    Invariant for why that's still equivalent to step 7's own answer within
    the same cycle (step 6 sets every device's devPresentLastScan, NIC
    children included, to exactly current_scan_presence_condition()'s value
    for this cycle, before step 7 ever reads it). Not a general-purpose
    presence predicate - it answers this one question, nothing broader.

    Deliberately NOT a replacement for current_scan_presence_condition() -
    composed with it via OR at each call site (insert_events()'s Device
    Down/Disconnected queries, update_devLastConnection_from_CurrentScan()).
    Deliberately does NOT replicate update_devPresentLastScan_based_on_nics()'s
    "parent was directly detected this scan" carve-out: that carve-out is
    redundant here, because a directly-detected parent already satisfies
    current_scan_presence_condition() on its own, and the two are OR'd.

    mac_column must be a trusted, hardcoded SQL column/table.column reference

    current_scan_presence_condition(), enforced the same way.

    The inner Devices scan is aliased as nic_presence_parent, not the more
    obvious nic_parent, for the same shadowing reason
    current_scan_presence_condition() aliases its own inner CurrentScan as
    presence_scan rather than bare CurrentScan: a caller correlating this
    condition from a query that itself aliases its row as nic_parent (a
    natural name to pick, given this helper's own docstring uses it) would
    otherwise have mac_column="nic_parent.devMac" resolve to this
    subquery's own inner alias instead of the caller's outer row, collapsing
    the comparison into an always-true same-row tautology - confirmed live
    in this exact shape in nic-parent-reconnect-events.md's implementation
